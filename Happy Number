Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        sum=0
        while n>1 and n!=4:
            tp=str(n)
            for i in range(len(tp)):
                n1= int(tp[i])**2
                sum+=n1
                n=sum
                if i==len(tp)-1:
                    sum=0
                    n1=0
                    break
        if n==1:
            return True
        else:
            return False
