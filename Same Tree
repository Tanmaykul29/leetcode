Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not q or not p:
            return False
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right) and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)
