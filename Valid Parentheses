Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        opening = {"]": "[", "}": "{", ")": "("}
        for ch in s:
            if ch in ["[", "{", "("]:
                stack.append(ch)
            else:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != opening[ch]:
                    return False
        return not stack
