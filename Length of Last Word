Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Solution:
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.strip()
        lis = list(s.split(" "))
        return len(lis[-1])
